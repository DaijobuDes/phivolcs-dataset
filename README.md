# phivolcs-datasets
A repository containing all data from PHIVOLCS earthquake data in CSV and JSON (still planned) formats.

All data is scraped from web, using a script I coded in Python, in [Department of Science and Technology - Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (DOST-PHIVOLCS) Website](https://earthquake.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/).

The website is public to anyone who can access the records of the recent and past earthquakes that have happened in the Philippines and this repository also serves as an archive of the earthquake events.
